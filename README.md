# Sign-Up-Form with validation
Idea by: The Odin Project

Validation includes:
1. min and max length of first name and last name (3-15 characters)
2. standard email validation to include @ symbol
3. phone number match format 000 000 00 00 or 000-000-00-00 or any combination of space and "-" like 000-000 00 00
4. password must be same and have 8 characters, 1 uppercase letter, 1 lowercase letter, 1 number and 1 special symbol

When form is submited it will log all data to console in table format
